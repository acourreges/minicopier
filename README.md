MiniCopier is a graphical copy manager. It provides more comfort and control over file copy operations than basic OS functions.  
You can use it to queue several transfers, resume a copy which has failed, limit the speed or pause the copy...  
MiniCopier is multiplatform and supports Linux, Windows and MacOS X systems.
